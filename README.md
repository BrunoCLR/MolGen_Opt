In this repository you will find the databases used to train the neural networks in the work titled "Molecule Generation and Optimization for Efficient Fragrance Creation".

There is one folder (named All) containing several fragrance molecules of varied smells. The other folders contain only molecules that have the fragrance note named in the folder. 
The molecules in each category were split into three files: train, test and validation.
